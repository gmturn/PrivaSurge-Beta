02/20/23 21:35 - Began work on the automation of temp email deletion after 15 days. There is now a temp_email_data table in vmail database which links and tracks necessary information. Additionally added a small piece of code that logs the date of the 
                    email creation in this data table (in createTempEmail function). The deletion of data from mailbox and forwardings aswell as from the actual file path still needs to be completed. 


02/17/23 19:00 - New commit to Github adding the functionality that requires the user to sign up to privasurge.com with a privasurge email. This new function creates a new email for the user and adds that email into the vmail mailbox and forwarding as 
                    well as the web_data.users table to make sure that they can then log into the website with that account and therefore manage their account. The web_id between users and mailbox is also successfully linked
